On the 20th July PCF will be enjoying a sunny summer bike ride around some new (and old) cycling infrastructure in the city.  The ride will start at the Hilsea Lines cafe, meeting from 1030 and departing at 1100, and will end up at Staggeringly Good Brewery for a refreshing beverage (or two).

The ride will be around 6.5 miles, is accessible to all types of bike, and everyone is welcome for a gentle paced ride around the city.
