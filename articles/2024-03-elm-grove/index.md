For years now, many cyclists have complained, reported and
commented about persistent anti-social parking in the painted
cycle lanes around the Elm Grove / Grove Road South crossroads.

In November 2020 [a trial scheme](https://pompeybug.co.uk/statement-on-elm-grove-cycle-lane-trial)
to provide protected cycle lanes along Elm Grove and Kings Road
was withdrawn within three weeks. However the feedback we received from 
cyclists was that finally (albeit for a short period) cyclists could
access the front of the motor vehicle queue safely. Our report
following the trial was that protection should remain here alongside
a method to stop parked vehicles blocking access to the protected space.

Funding for a scheme to achieve this was approved by the [Transport
Cabinet member in December 2021](https://pompeybug.co.uk/2021-12-02-deputation),
and two years later [we asked for an update](https://pompeybug.co.uk/2023-12-30-elm-grove/)
and whether it would ever happen.

Finally a Traffic Regulation order has been issued and **we would like as
many cyclists as possible to respond to the public consultation to
support the scheme as designed** (so read on!).

## Step 1: Understand the TRO

We have included an image of the
proposed design below, but urge you to visit the council website to
[read _all_ the documentation](https://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/services/parking-roads-and-travel/roads/traffic-regulation-orders-2024/#southsea%3C/a:~:text=Elm%20Grove%20%26%20Grove%20Road%20South%20(P004%20%E2%80%93%2024)%20%E2%80%93%20Notice%20of%20Intent%20%E2%80%93%20Draft%20Order%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20Statement%20of%20Reasons%20%E2%80%93%20Plans)
and study a better quality drawing.

TRO Excerpt:
> A mandatory cycle lane (with protection by Orca Wands) is proposed
> on the approaches to the signalised junction on Elm Grove at its
> approaches with Grove Road North and South. To achieve the required
> width for the cycle lanes, a reduction in parking places is required
> to the east of Grove Road North. To mitigate the loss of parking,
> additional parking places are proposed on Grove Road South as well
> as motor cycle and pedal cycle parking places on Elm Grove, west
> of Grove Road North.

The current painted cycle lanes will be widened and then protected
by wands in a similar manner to the recent additions along Goldsmith
Avenue. Designated motorcycle parking and a cycle corral ([as seen at
the eastern end of Marmion Road](https://www.google.com/maps/@50.7852488,-1.0837611,3a,27.3y,84.62h,82t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swygQfxDRyockQ14sliwl8A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu)) will be added. We hope the spacing
between the corral and first wand will stop motor vehicles parking
here to block cycle access to the eastbound lane.

Although not listed within the TRO information, we understand that
some changes to the phasing and timings of the traffic lights are
proposed as a way for reducing the number of collisions and casualties
that have occurred in the middle of the junction itself, often as a
result of turning across traffic from the north and south arms of
the junction. We do not believe that this includes the addition of
a low level cycle early release phase from Grove Road North however.

The most resistance to the scheme will probably come from the removal
of parking spaces on Elm Grove.  The PCF committee are concerned
about the new location for two one-hour restricted parking spaces
on Grove Road South due to the potential for just creating a new
obstruction to the free flow of highway here. Southbound cyclists will
now have to manoeuvre around stationery vehicles, and northbound
cyclists will face oncoming vehicles in their lane (including buses
exiting the nearby bus stop).

There are also concerns about how often the one hour parking restrictions
on these new spaces will be enforced. If Elm Grove already had sufficient,
regular enforcement it's unlikely that the regular parking infringements
would occur.

Additionally, with planning permission recently given for the
[St. John's College site](https://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=RZU6BKMO0JP00&activeTab=summary),
there will be an increase in construction vehicles using the road to
access the site, along with the associated traffic movements once
building is complete.

## Step 2: Respond to PCC
The deadline for responses is **no later than 10th April 2024**. Responses
should be emailed to [TROteam@portsmouthcc.gov.uk](mailto:TROteam@portsmouthcc.gov.uk?subject=Elm%20Grove%20TRO&cc=info@pompeybug.co.uk)
and clearly state whether you support the proposed scheme.
