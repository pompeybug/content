Andy and his wife Xel, are the founders of [Coconuts](http://coconuts.delivery), Portsmouth's first cargo bike delivery service. Launched in 2022, the idea came to life when Andy, a long-time cycling and active travel enthusiast, discovered a cargo bike that had been retired by its previous owner. Since then, the family has dedicated themselves to developing and perfecting the concept of a cargo bike delivery service. Today, Coconuts cargo bike can be spotted around Portsmouth, delivering goods for various businesses, saving both time and the planet.

## How do you use your bike around Portsmouth and beyond?

I started using this bike at Christmas 2022 when my church was delivering hampers locally in Buckland, North End, and Hilsea. It was the perfect opportunity to test the bike. One lunchtime, I took it out and made six deliveries in some of Portsmouth's busiest areas. It was ideal—I tracked my time on Strava and saw that I did pretty well. Plus, I saved time by parking right next to each house. I realised that Portsmouth really needed this service. 

In early 2023, I participated in the University's enterprise program, a 10-week course with weekly talks from entrepreneurs. As the course progressed, the idea for Coconuts developed. In the final session, we pitched in groups and received great feedback. We also applied for the competition and won the Enterprising Spirit award. We received a grant, a desk in the innovation space, and a mentor. 

This validation showed me that others believed in the idea too. It motivated us to take Coconuts and cargo bike deliveries more seriously.

## Why Coconuts?

One day when we were at Southsea cinema, I suggested the name "Coconuts". My wife was unsure at first, but I envisioned it sparking curiosity. It’s easy to read and pronounce, unlike some tricky company names.

Earlier that week, "Coconuts" kept popping up. Playing with Danielle, we saw a Blippi episode about coconut ice cream. During a remote meeting, a transcription included "coconuts." Later, while watching Moana with Danièle, there was a song about coconuts. It felt like a sign, and I realised it was a great name.

Our Coconuts bike naturally sparks conversations. When I park it in the city, especially in creative spots due to our temporary lack of storage, people often ask, "What is this?" It’s a great conversation starter.

## What do you like about travelling by bike?

As kids, we rode our bikes around our cul-de-sac in Portchester, enjoying the relatively car-free streets. When we were teenagers, a group of us would cycle to the countryside, sometimes as far as Droxford. Those rides felt like big adventures, giving us a sense of freedom. One of my fondest memories is from a holiday in France. My parents hired me a bike, and I experienced my first taste of freedom riding along the coast. 

Cycling energises me and has helped me reconnect with old friends. I started riding with a school friend I'd lost touch with, and we’d ride around Portsmouth, stopping for coffee at the pier. 

As an introvert, cycling is perfect because it allows me to socialise in a group while maintaining some distance. Riding around the city, I feel a sense of solidarity with other cyclists, especially when commuting in the rain. Seeing others making an effort to cycle, even with kids, is inspiring and fosters a sense of community.

## What isn’t so great about cycling in the city?

The biggest challenge is the worsening attitude between people, whether I'm on my bike or in my car. Communication tends to be negative, and this isn't unique to Portsmouth.

There's a divide where people see themselves as either cyclists or drivers. This mindset needs to change. I enjoy driving, probably because I don't do it often. I cycle during the week, so by the weekend, I look forward to driving to places like National Trust sites.

Changing how people interact on the road is crucial. While infrastructure improvements are happening, much depends on politics and the council. 

We need long-term, passionate council members and middle management who will advocate for change despite the political climate, which often focuses on parking and traffic during short terms in office.

## What else would you like to add?

My message to people, especially those with families, is to include them in cycling. It doesn't have to be extreme. We recently got a fold-up bike, which my short-statured wife found suitable and enjoyable. It's about doing it together. Our daughter, Danielle, also has a little bike, so we try to include everyone, even if it's just a short ride. This way, kids can have the cycling experience, even in tougher environments.

If you have a friend who is hesitant, I'd suggest to start with a ride together—it's a natural choice. Afterward, grab a coffee and cake to make it enjoyable and sociable.

One piece of advice that always stuck with me was to "prepare your clothes the night before." It minimises morning excuses like being disorganised or the weather changing unexpectedly. While I admit I haven't always followed this advice religiously, it's incredibly practical. Just getting your outfit ready the night before can make starting the day much easier.

We are grateful to Andy and Xel for sharing their story with us. Their journey shows how a passion for cycling can spark innovative ideas that revolutionise deliveries, making them more city and environmentally friendly. We will be closely following Andy's progress and look forward to seeing more cargo bikes on our streets, enhancing safety and promoting a cycling-friendly environment.
